Project Overview

The Salary Prediction Project is a machine learning application designed to predict employee salaries based on various professional and personal features. The project aims to help organizations and job seekers estimate salaries for different roles using data-driven insights.

This project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and a user-friendly interface to provide real-time salary predictions.

Features

Predict salaries for employees based on input features such as experience, job role, and education.

Interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

Data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Multiple regression models implemented and evaluated to select the best-performing one.

Visualizations for data insights and model performance.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Dataset

The dataset contains features such as Years of Experience, Education Level, Job Role, and corresponding Salary.

Data cleaning and preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing or inconsistent values

Encoding categorical variables

Normalization or scaling of numerical features

Future Enhancements

Expand dataset with more features such as location, industry, and company size.

Implement advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks for better predictions.

Add authentication and save prediction history in the Streamlit app.

Deploy as a cloud-based application for global accessibility.
